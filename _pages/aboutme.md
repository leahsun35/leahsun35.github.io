About Me😶
---
I am currently a Master of Science in Economics student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). My primary academic focus lies at the intersection of Labor Economics, Family Economics, and Macroeconomics. I also have a strong background in Applied Econometrics, frequently utilizing Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and synthetic control methods for policy evaluation, alongside exploring New Keynesian models.
